The `mutate()` function in the `dplyr` package can be combined with conditional statements using the `if_else()` function or base R's `ifelse()` to create or modify columns based on certain conditions.

Here's how you can use the `if_else()` function within `mutate()`:

### Example:

Let's consider a scenario using the `flights_data` dataset that we generated previously. Suppose we want to categorize the flights based on their delay:

- "On Time" if `Delay` is between -15 to 15 minutes.
- "Early" if `Delay` is less than -15 minutes.
- "Delayed" if `Delay` is greater than 15 minutes.

We can achieve this using the following code:

```R
library(dplyr)

flights_data <- flights_data %>%
  mutate(Flight_Status = if_else(Delay < -15, "Early",
                                 if_else(Delay <= 15, "On Time", "Delayed")))

# Check the first few rows of the dataset to see the new Flight_Status column
head(flights_data)
```

Here, `if_else()` is used in a nested manner. The function has a structure like this:

```R
if_else(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)
```

This allows us to have multiple conditions. The `if_else()` function is generally more type-safe and faster than the base R `ifelse()` function, especially with larger datasets. However, the logic and usage are quite similar between the two functions.

 Let's break down this code step by step, focusing on the `"On Time"` and `"Delayed"` portions.

The code snippet provided utilizes the `mutate()` function from the `dplyr` package to create a new column called `Flight_Status` in the `flights_data` dataframe. The value of this new column is determined by the `Delay` column and the `if_else()` function. 

Here's the logic:

1. **`if_else(Delay < -15, "Early", ...)`**:
   - This first `if_else` checks if the `Delay` is less than -15. If it's true, it labels the flight as `"Early"`. Otherwise, it proceeds to the next condition.
   
2. **`if_else(Delay <= 15,"On Time", "Delayed")`**:
   - This nested `if_else` checks if the `Delay` is less than or equal to 15.
     - If true, it labels the flight as `"On Time"`.
     - If false, it labels the flight as `"Delayed"`.
   
Let's delve deeper into the `"On Time"` and `"Delayed"` portions:

- **"On Time"**: 
  - As per the code, a flight is considered `"On Time"` if its delay is within 15 minutes of the scheduled time, either early or late. This means if the delay value is between -15 and 15 (inclusive), the flight status will be set as `"On Time"`. 
  - For instance, if the `Delay` value is 10, or -10, or 0, the flight is considered `"On Time"`.
  
- **"Delayed"**: 
  - If the above conditions for `"Early"` and `"On Time"` are not met, then by default, the flight is labeled as `"Delayed"`. Practically, this means any flight with a `Delay` value greater than 15 will be considered `"Delayed"`.
  - For instance, if the `Delay` value is 20, the flight is considered `"Delayed"`.

In essence, this code uses nested `if_else()` functions to categorize the flights into three categories based on their delay values:
1. Early (if the delay is less than -15 minutes).
2. On Time (if the delay is between -15 and 15 minutes, inclusive).
3. Delayed (if the delay is greater than 15 minutes).
