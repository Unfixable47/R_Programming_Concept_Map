[[data structures]]-   **vectors** [[Vectors]]

Vector (R)
		A group of data elements of the same type stored in a sequence in R
		You can make a vector using the conbine function a vector looks like:
					c(x,y,z....)
					vec_1 <- c(13, 48.5,  71, 101.5, 2)
					vec_1 
						will return vectors


atomic vectors   
list- are different from atomic vectors because their elements can be of any type â€“ like dates, data frames, vectors, matrices, and more. List can even contain other list.
 
 **data fram****e****s:** are the most common way of storing an analyzing data in R they are a collection of colmns-similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table each column has a name at the top that represents a variable and includes one observation per row.

First colmns should be named
second, data frames can include many different types of data, like numeric, logical or character.
Finally elements in the same column should be of the same type.
        
Matrices: a Matrx is a two dimensional collection of data elements. This means it has both rows and columns. By contract a vector is one dimensional sequence of data elements. But like vectors matrices can only contain a single data type
arrays
