***Basic concepts of R***
	Functions: A body of reusable code used to perform specific tasks R
	Argument ( R ): information that a function in R need in order to run
			print("coding in R")
			print = function
			?print() for more help
	Variables: a representation of a values in R that can stored for use later during programming ‚Üê assignment operator assigns the value to the variable
			Variables can also be called "objects"
			Variables name should start with a letter and can also contain numbers and underscores
						# here is an example of a variable
						first_variable <- "this is my variable"
						second_variable <- 12.5
	[[Operators]]:  A symbol that names the type of operation or calculations to be performmed in a formula 
	Comments: 
			should be really readable
			it usually starts with a #
	Data Types:
			Vectors a group of data elements of the same type stored in a sequence in R
