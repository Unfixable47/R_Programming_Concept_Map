Logical Operators
		return a logical data type such as true and false AND operators take two logical values. It returns true only if both value are TRUE if you run the corresponding code in R, you get following results:ctures]]

Arithmetic Operators
	example:
	quarter_1_sales <- 35657.98
	quater_2_sales <- 43810.55
	midyears_sales <- quater_1_sales + quaters_2_sales
	enter midyears_sales in consol to get results 
		use to complete math calculations
			+ (addition)
			- (subtraction)
			* (mulitpulcation)
			/ (division)

Relational Operators
	Known as comparators
		allow you to compare values operators identify how one R object relates to another-like whether an object in less than, equal to, or greater than another object. 
			the output for relational operators is either TRUE or FALSE (which is a logical data type or boolean)
		The table below summarize the six relational operators in R. the examples used in the table are based on the creation of two variables
