Let's break down how the loop with strings works in the provided R code. The code aims to create a time series plot for each country in a dataset, showing the trend of Union Density over time.

### Understanding the Components:

1. **Data Frame (`joined_full_data_set`)**: This is your dataset, which includes at least three columns: `ref_area` (country names), `time` (time points), and `Union Density` (a numeric value representing union density at each time point for each country).

2. **Unique Country Names (`country_focus`)**: 
   ```R
   country_focus <- unique(joined_full_data_set$ref_area)
   ```
   This line extracts all unique country names from the `ref_area` column of your dataset. The `unique()` function ensures each country is listed only once, regardless of how many times it appears in the dataset.

### The Loop:

3. **For Loop Over Countries**:
   ```R
   for(country in country_focus){
       ...
   }
   ```
   The loop iterates over each element in `country_focus`, which contains unique country names. In each iteration, the variable `country` takes on the value of the current country name being processed.

4. **Data Filtering**:
   ```R
   TUD_country <- joined_full_data_set %>%
       filter(ref_area == country)
   ```
   Inside the loop, this code filters `joined_full_data_set` for the current `country`. It uses `dplyr`'s `filter()` function to create a subset of the data (`TUD_country`) that includes only rows where `ref_area` matches the current country name.

5. **Plotting**:
   ```R
   p <- ggplot(TUD_country, aes(x = time, y = `Union Density`)) +
       geom_line() + ...
   ```
   For each country, a line plot is created using `ggplot2`. The plot (`p`) uses time as the x-axis and Union Density as the y-axis. The `labs()` and `theme_minimal()` functions are used to add labels and apply a minimal theme to the plot.

6. **Storing the Plots**:
   ```R
   plots[[country]] <- p
   ```
   Each plot is stored in a list called `plots`, indexed by the country name. This allows you to access each plot later by referring to the country name.

### Accessing the Plots:

7. **Viewing a Specific Plot**:
   ```R
   # print(plots[["United States"]])
   ```
   After the loop, you can view the plot for a specific country by using `print()` with the country name as the index in the `plots` list.

### Summary:

- The loop iterates over each unique country name.
- For each iteration, it filters the data for that country, creates a plot for that country, and stores the plot in a list.
- The plots can be accessed individually using the country name as the key.

This approach is useful for automating the process of creating similar plots for different subsets of a dataset.
