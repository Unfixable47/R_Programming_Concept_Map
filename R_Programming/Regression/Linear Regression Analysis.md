#### Simple linear regression
Does the weekly working time have an influence on the hourly salary of employees?
- the goal is predict the value of dependent variable based on an independent variable. The greater the linear relationship between the two variables the more accurate the prediction. 
- Visually the they the two variables can be represented in a scatter plot the greater the linear relationship between the dependent the and independent variable.
- a straight line is used to determine the type of the relationship between the two variables. 
- The straight line is created utilizing the method of less squared.

#### Multiple linear Regression
Do the weekly working hours and the age of employees have an influence on their hourly salary?

-  Unlike simple linear regression, multiple linear regression can include two or more independent variables. 
-  The goal is to estimate one variable based on several other variables. 
-  The variables to be estimated is called the **dependent variable (criterion)** the variables that are used for prediction are called **independent variables (predictors)**
