A regression analysis makes it possible to predict another variable on the basis of one or more variables.

### 1 Measurement of the influence of one or more variables on another variable?
- What influences children ability to concentrate? 
- Do parent's educational level and place of residence affect children's future educational attainment


### 2 Prediction of a variable by one or more other variables
- How long does a patient stay in the hospital? 
- What product is a person most likely to buy from an online store
- the independent variable can be Metric, Ordinal, Nominal

### Simple linear Regression
- in a simple linear regression you use only one independent variable to predict a dependent variable.
- the independent variable can be M Metric, Ordinal, Nominal
- dependent variable is metric

### Multiple Linear Regression 
- In multiple linear regression several independent variables are used to predict the dependent variable.
- dependent variable is metric
- the independent variable can be Metric, Ordinal, Nominal
### Logistic Regression 
- Logistic Regression is used when you have a categorical dependent variable.
- dependent variable is categorical (Nominal or Ordinal)
- the independent variable can be Metric, Ordinal, Nominal

### Categorical Variables (Nominal or ordinal )
 Variables may classically have two characteristics 
 If the variables have more than two characteristics than you must for dummy variables

## Forms of Regression Analysis

### Examples: 
Simple Linear Regression:
- Does the weekly working time have an influence on the hourly wage of employees.

Multiple linear regression: 
- Does the weekly working time and the age of employees have an influence on the hourly wage

Logistic Regression: 
- Does the weekly working time and the age of employees have an influence on the probability of having at least one employee
