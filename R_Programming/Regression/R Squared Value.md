-  R squared is between 0% and 100% with 100% being the most accurate the model can be. 
- R squared values are dependent on the field of study you are in, some fields of study will generally have lower R squared values than others. 
- You can have a model be good if it as low R squared just as long as the variables being studied are statically significant.
- R squared evaluates the fit of the model and weather it is going to be useful. 
- Always evualant the residuals as R squared isnt the only indicator as to whether the model will fit the data. For more information on whether the model fits check out [[Does the Model Fit?]]



## Residual Patters 
-  a better residual fit is where the data is randomly scattered around the line RANDOM is better
- the line also has to fit the data it shouldn't go under or over the the points in the graphs to much (this is called over fitting or under fitting)
