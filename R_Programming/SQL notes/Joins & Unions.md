Joins Vs Unions
	==Joins add more columns to your data set, while unions add more rows to your data set.

Full JOIN
	full outer join returns all reords when there is a match in left table or right table 
	FULL OUT JOIN and FULL JOIN ARE THE SAME


>SQL UNION operator
	UNION operator is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements 1
		every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
		the columns must also have similar data types 
		the columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order
	By combing queries with UNION the results will elimnate duplicates
