The summary of your regression model (`model_FACB`), which predicts `FACB` based on `Collective Bargaining Coverage` and `Union Density`, provides several important insights. Let's interpret these results:

### Coefficients:
1. **Intercept (2.981751)**: This is the expected value of `FACB` when both `Collective Bargaining Coverage` and `Union Density` are 0. The large t-value and very small p-value indicate that the intercept is significantly different from zero.

2. **Collective Bargaining Coverage (0.007386)**: The coefficient for `Collective Bargaining Coverage` suggests a very small positive relationship with `FACB`. However, the t-value is 0.904, and the p-value is 0.367, which means this relationship is not statistically significant. In practical terms, changes in `Collective Bargaining Coverage` do not have a significant impact on `FACB`.

3. **Union Density (-0.037368)**: This coefficient is statistically significant (p = 3.46e-14). The negative sign indicates an inverse relationship: as `Union Density` increases, `FACB` tends to decrease. For each unit increase in `Union Density`, `FACB` decreases by about 0.037368 units, holding `Collective Bargaining Coverage` constant.

### Model Fit:
1. **Residual Standard Error (1.631)**: This value represents the average distance of the data points from the fitted regression line. A lower value indicates a better fit.

2. **Multiple R-squared (0.2979)**: Approximately 29.79% of the variability in `FACB` is explained by the model. This value suggests that the model explains a moderate portion of the variance in `FACB`, but other factors not included in the model might also play a significant role.

3. **Adjusted R-squared (0.292)**: This is a modification of the R-squared that adjusts for the number of predictors in the model. It's very close to the R-squared, indicating that the model is appropriately sized for the number of predictors.

4. **F-statistic (50.91)**: The F-statistic and its associated p-value (< 2.2e-16) indicate that the overall model is statistically significant.

### Conclusion:
`Union Density` is a significant predictor of `FACB`, with a negative relationship. In contrast, `Collective Bargaining Coverage` does not significantly predict `FACB` when controlling for `Union Density`. This model provides valuable insights into how these factors are interrelated, but it also suggests that additional variables not included in the model might be important in explaining `FACB`.
