### Question: Relationship between Sepal and Petal Dimensions

The `iris` dataset provides measurements on the length and width of sepals and petals for three species of iris plants. Using this data:

1. **Feature Engineering**: Create two new variables:
    - `Sepal.Area`: Product of `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width`.
    - `Petal.Area`: Product of `Petal.Length` and `Petal.Width`.
        
2. **Descriptive Analysis**:
    - Calculate the mean and standard deviation of `Sepal.Area` and `Petal.Area` for each species.
        
3. **Visualization**:
    - Plot a scatter plot of `Sepal.Area` against `Petal.Area`. Color the points by species. What patterns can you discern from this plot?
    - For each species, plot a histogram of `Sepal.Area` and `Petal.Area` side by side. How do the distributions differ across species?
        
4. **Statistical Testing**:
    - Test if the means of `Sepal.Area` and `Petal.Area` are statistically different between the species. Consider using ANOVA for this purpose.
        
5. **Correlation**:
    - For each species, calculate the correlation between `Sepal.Area` and `Petal.Area`. Is there a strong relationship between these two newly created features for each species?
        
6. **Conclusions**:
    - Based on the analysis, can you conclude that larger sepals are associated with larger petals (or vice-versa)? Does this relationship hold true for all species or are there exceptions?
        

This question aims to deepen your understanding of relationships between different features in the dataset and allows for exploration, visualization, and statistical testing. When you're done with the analysis, remember to provide interpretations for each of your findings.
