Here's a practice problem involving data exploration and analysis in R using the `iris` dataset.

**Problem:**

The `iris` dataset is a classic dataset in the world of data science and statistics. It contains data about three species of iris plants, specifically the measurements of their sepals and petals.

Using the `iris` dataset:

1. Provide a summary of the dataset, highlighting the mean, median, and range for each measurement (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) for each species.
    
2. Plot the distribution of each measurement (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) using histograms. Color the histograms based on species.
    
3. Determine which species has the highest average petal length.
    
4. Identify any potential outliers in sepal width for each species using a boxplot.
    
5. Using a scatter plot, visualize the relationship between sepal length and petal length. Color the points based on species and fit a linear regression line to the plot.
    
6. Calculate the correlation coefficient between sepal length and petal length for each species.
    

After you complete the tasks, provide a brief analysis based on your findings.
