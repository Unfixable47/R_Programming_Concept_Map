Absolutely! This time, let's focus on different `tidyr` functions: `nest()`, `unnest()`, and `hoist()`. These functions are used for managing complex nested data structures, which is a common task in more advanced data manipulation and analysis.

### Background:
Imagine you're working with a dataset that records daily sales data for different products across various stores. Each store has multiple products, and for each product, there's a list of daily sales figures.

### Dataset:

```r
# Install the packages if not already installed
# install.packages("tidyr")
# install.packages("dplyr")

# Load the libraries
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

# Create the dataset
sales_data <- tibble(
  store_id = rep(1:3, each = 4),
  product_id = rep(c("A", "B", "C", "D"), times = 3),
  daily_sales = list(1:7, 2:8, 3:9, 4:10, 5:11, 6:12, 7:13, 8:14, 9:15, 10:16, 11:17, 12:18)
)
```

### Tasks:

1. **Nesting Data**: Use the `nest()` function to create a nested dataframe where each store contains all its products and their corresponding daily sales data. The resulting table should have columns for `store_id` and `data` (where `data` is a nested tibble with `product_id` and `daily_sales`).

2. **Unnesting Data**: Take the nested dataframe and use `unnest()` to expand the nested tibble back into the original format.

3. **Extracting Nested Data**: Use the `hoist()` function to extract the first day's sales from each `daily_sales` list into a new column called `first_day_sales`.

### Example Code to Begin:

```r
# Assuming the sales_data tibble is already created

# Task 1: Nest data by store_id
nested_data <- sales_data %>%
  group_by(store_id) %>%
  nest()

# Continue with tasks 2 and 3 as described above
```

Feel free to complete the remaining tasks. This exercise will give you a hands-on understanding of how to work with nested data structures in R using `tidyr`.
